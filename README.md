# CMIP7_processing
Code and routines to process CMIP7 forcing datasets for use in CESM3 (Community Earth System Model). Code is developed primarily in Python.

## Input forcing datasets
Forcing datasets can be found at: https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7-task-teams/forcings/ 

On the UCAR HPC system, they can be found at:
/glade/campaign/<TBD \location>

## Methodology
Processing is broken into different components routines.
