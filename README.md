# CMIP7_processing
Code and routines to process CMIP7 forcing datasets for use in CESM3 (Community Earth System Model). Code is developed primarily in Python.

## Input forcing datasets
Forcing datasets can be found at: https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7-task-teams/forcings/ 

On the UCAR HPC system, they can be found on campaign:
- raw datasets: `/glade/campaign/cesm/cesmdata/input4MIPs_raw`
- cesm-ready data in: `/glade/campaign/cesm/cesmdata/inputdata`

## Methodology
Processing is broken into different components/sources.

### Anthropogenic (including aircrafts emissions)

### Biomass Burning

### Volcanic Forcing

### Soil and Ocean

### Biogenic

### Solar Forcing
