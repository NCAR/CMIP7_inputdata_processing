# This is a git submodule file with additional support for
# # git-fleximod (https://github.com/ESMCI/git-fleximod)
# #
# # The additional flags supported by git-fleximod are
# # fxtag - the tag associated with the submodule, this tag can be tested for
# #         consistancy with the submodule hash using git-fleximod status
# #         the hash can be updated to the tag using git-fleximod update
# #
# # fxrequired - indicates if a given submodule should be checked out on install
# #              submoudules can be toplevel or internal and required or optional
# #              toplevel means that the submodule should only be checked out if the
# #              module is the toplevel of the git repo (is not a submodule itself)
# #              internal means that the submodule is needed by the component whether
# #              the component is toplevel or the submodule of another repo
# #              required means that the submodule should always be checked out
# #              optional means that the submodule should only be checked out if the
# #              optional flag is provided to git-fleximod or the submodule name is
# #              explicitly listed on the git-fleximod command line.
# #
# # fxsparse -   this is a path to a git sparse checkout file indicating that the
# #              submodule should be checked out in sparse mode
# #
# # fxDONOTUSEurl    -   this field is used by git-fleximod test to insure that the url is pointing
# #              to the official url of the repo and not to an unofficial fork.
# #              It is intended for use of github workflows to test commits to protected
# #              repository branches.
