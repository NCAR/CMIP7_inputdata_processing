# Landuse Datasets for CTSM

There are two parts to the landuse datasets for CMIP7.

The first part is creation of "raw" PFT datasets from which the surface datasets and landuse.timeseries files will be created. This
is:

`` shell
cd LandUseDataPrepTools
# Follow the instructions in the README files (README.md, README.configure and README.process) there
# Start with README.md
# Second go through steps in README.configure
# Third go through the process chain from README.process
```

The second part is to use those datasets to create the surface and landuse.timeseries files using `mksurfdata_esmf` which is a tool
under a CTSM checkout. Here it is checked out as a submodule in the subdirectory `ctsm5.4_for_mksurfdat`. To use it do the
following:

`` shell
cd ctsm5.4_for_mksurfdat
./py_env_create --yes      # It's required to have the ctsm_pylib conda environment setup to use the tools
conda activate ctsm_pylib
cd tools/mksurfdata_esmf
# Follow the instructions in the README.md file there
# Two easy tests to try are to build the executable and use make to create some low resolution datasets:
./gen_mksurfdata_build       # This builds mksurfdata_esmf and takes several minutes to complete
make 1x1_brazil-present      # This runs a simple creation interactively and will take a minute to finish
make global-present-low-res  # This submits jobs to Derecho and will return quickly, but the jobs will take less than an hour to complete
```
