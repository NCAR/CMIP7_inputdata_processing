# Landuse Datasets for CTSM

There are two parts to the landuse datasets for CMIP7.

The first part is creation of "raw" PFT datasets from which the surface datasets and landuse.timeseries files will be created.

The second part is to use those datasets to create the surface and landuse.timeseries files using mksurfdata_esmf which is a tool
under a CTSM checkout.
